## Description

This application will evaluate the electron configuration of a given element. The application uses JOptionPane dialogs for input/output. The application will accept either an element symbol or an atomic number.

For example, an input of either **Fe** or **26** will both result in:

```
1s^2 2s^2 2p^6 3s^2 3p^6 4s^2 3d^6
```

## Usage

To use the Electron Configuration Evaluator, simply execute the jar file included in release v1.0.

If you want to take a look at the code, all of the code is included in the repository's *source_code* folder.

## Why

The reason why I made this script was not just to find the electron configurations (google can do that), but to better understand how to calculate the configurations by hand.
